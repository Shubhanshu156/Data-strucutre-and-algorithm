'''BFS IS USED TO FIND SMALLEST 
DISTANCE BETWEEN START AND END POINT
'''


first create a matrix for visited and distance with one extra column and row SO IT easy to reach node with same number
now we will call the function with coordinates which we have to start 
then run a loop till queue is not empty
then append that coordinates to queue then move to all four direction which are valid
then append  coordinates that  are valid to queue
