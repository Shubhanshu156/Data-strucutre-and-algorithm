BIPARTITE GRAPH:A Bipartite Graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two independent sets, U
                and V such that every edge (u, v) either connects a vertex from U to V or a vertex from V
                to U. In other words, for every edge (u, v), either u belongs to U and v to V, or u belongs 
                to V and v to U. We can also say that there is no edge that connects vertices of same set

basic logic behind bipartite graph is to alternatly color all nodes we are able to do that then this is bipartite graph otherwise this is not
take a node make all its child color opposite of that node if color of node an d child are same then print(no)
